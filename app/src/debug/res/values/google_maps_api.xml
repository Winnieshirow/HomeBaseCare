    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    1F:B3:3F:4B:C3:13:C3:30:07:D5:68:01:16:EE:57:5F:4D:73:14:27

    1F:B3:3F:4B:C3:13:C3:30:07:D5:68:01:16:EE:57:5F:4D:73:14:27

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
